  "This test runs a pass-the-ball algorithm with 4 threads
that take turns consuming (take) and producing (put) values in 4 cells.

Two threads consume values from cells 1 or 2, increase the value by one,
and produce into cells 3 or 4.
Two other threads consume values from cells 3 or 4, increase the value by one,
and produce into cells 1 or 2.

Consuming a value \"from cells x or y\" means (atomic (orelse (take cell-x) (take cell-y))),
i.e. if taking from the first cell fails, the second cell is used.
If that fails too, the thread sleeps until one of the two cells is available for (take)
- this sleeping and retrying behaviour is automatically implemented by
\(atomic (orelse <action1> <action2>)).

Similarly, producing a value \"into cells x or y\" means
\(atomic (orelse (put cell-x value) (put cell-y value))),
i.e. if putting into the first cell fails, the second cell is used.
If that fails too, the thread sleeps until one of the two cells is available for (put)
- again, this sleeping and retrying behaviour is automatically implemented by
\(atomic (orelse <action1> <action2>)).

The test first creates the threads, then atomically puts the four values
\(0 0.25 0.5 0.75) in the cells to trigger the pass-the-ball among the threads,
and finishes after each thread executed ITERATIONS loops, returning the final cell values."

;;;; ** Running


(defmacro atomic (&rest body)
  "Main entry point for STMX.

Run BODY in a memory transaction. All changes to transactional memory
will be visible to other threads only after BODY returns normally (commits).
If BODY signals an error, its effects on transactional memory are rolled back
and the error is propagated normally.
Also, no work-in-progress transactional memory will ever be visible to other
threads.

A memory transaction can also retry: in such case ATOMIC will abort it,
wait until some of the value read by the transaction have changed,
then re-run the transaction from the beginning.

Since STMX transactions do not lock memory, it is possible for different
transactions to try to update the same memory (almost) simultaneously.
In such case, the conflict is detected when they try to commit or rollback,
and only one conflicting transaction is allowed to commit:
all others are immediately re-run again from the beginning,
also ignoring any error they may have signalled.

For this reason, a transaction ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT perform any irreversible
operation such as INPUT/OUTPUT: the result would be that I/O is executed
multiple times, or executed even when it should not!
Irreversible operations MUST be performed OUTSIDE transactions,
for example by queueing them into transactional memory that another thread
will consume and then, OUTSIDE transactions, actually perform them.

For how to create transactional memory, see TRANSACTIONAL or TVAR.
For another way to run transactions, see also TRANSACTION.
For advanced features inside transactions, see RETRY, ORELSE, NONBLOCKING,
    BEFORE-COMMIT and AFTER-COMMIT.

For pre-defined transactional classes, see the package STMX.UTIL"
